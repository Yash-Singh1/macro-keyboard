# Macro Keyboard

This is the C code that runs on my Raspberry PI Pico, that I use as a wireless keyboard. Currently just a slides clicker, thinking of adding profiles later. I'm pretty sure it's an assembled version of Maggie Liu's Macropad, <https://github.com/maggie-j-liu/macropad>, because I got it from Hackclub.
